**Hack for Social Impact - Bay Area Affordable Housing Development**
**Fetch Compare Build
Powered by Optimistic AI Philosophers**
This project aims to leverage the power of advanced AI and decentralized technologies to assist with comparing building codes across jurisdictions in the Bay Area. The goal is to support affordable housing development by simplifying the process of analyzing and aligning building regulations.

Tech Stack
Database: PostgreSQL
NLP Processing and Comparison Analysis: Python
Frontend: Streamlit (HTML, CSS)
Decentralized Autonomous Agents: Fetch.ai
Overview
This application uses Fetch.ai's decentralized autonomous agents to automate the comparison of building codes between different jurisdictions (e.g., San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose). By analyzing the similarities and differences between building codes, the system provides valuable insights that help stakeholders in the affordable housing sector make more informed decisions, streamline compliance, and promote collaboration across jurisdictions.

The Fetch.ai agent utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to:

Compare building code documents.
Extract technical terms and key differences.
Calculate similarity scores between different codes.
Identify common terms used across codes.
