**Fetch Compare Build**

**Powered by Optimistic AI Philosophers 🤖✨**


This project leverages advanced AI and decentralized technologies to assist with comparing building codes across jurisdictions in the Bay Area. The goal is to support affordable housing development by simplifying the process of analyzing and aligning building regulations.

Tech Stack 💻🔧

Database: PostgreSQL 🗃️

NLP Processing and Comparison Analysis: Python 🐍

Frontend: Streamlit (HTML, CSS) 🌐

Decentralized Autonomous Agents: Fetch.ai 🌍🤖

Overview 🌟

This application uses Fetch.ai's decentralized autonomous agents to automate the comparison of building codes between different jurisdictions (e.g., San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose). By analyzing the similarities and differences between building codes, the system provides valuable insights to help stakeholders in the affordable housing sector make more informed decisions, streamline compliance, and promote collaboration across jurisdictions.

The Fetch.ai agent utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to:

Compare building code documents 📜➡️📜

Extract technical terms 🏗️🔍

Calculate similarity scores 🔢

Identify common terms 💬

Fetch.ai Agent for Building Code Comparison 🧠🤝

How it Works:
The Fetch.ai agent plays a critical role in the backend of the application. Here's how it contributes to the project:

1. Agent Initialization 🔑

A Fetch.ai agent is initialized to handle building code comparison tasks. The agent uses a secure seed to authenticate and connect to the Fetch.ai network, where it listens for incoming requests to compare building code documents.

3. Code Comparison Model 📊
   
The agent works with a custom CodeComparisonModel to receive building code data. Each comparison consists of two building codes (content1 and content2), which the agent will analyze for:

Similarities 💡

Differences ❌

Key technical terms 🔑

3. Comparison Analysis 🔍

The agent uses Fetch.ai's NLP capabilities to perform:

Textual similarity analysis: Compare the two code documents and calculate a similarity score 📈

Entity extraction: Identify technical terms within the codes (e.g., safety regulations, construction terms) 🛠️

Textual differences: Highlight differences in phrasing, requirements, or specifications between the two codes ⚖️

Common terms: Identify terms that are shared across both codes, helping stakeholders see where jurisdictions align 🤝

4. Query Handling 📨

The agent listens for incoming queries and processes them asynchronously, ensuring efficient and timely responses ⚡. This allows the comparison of multiple building codes at scale, making it an ideal tool for comparing codes across different jurisdictions.

6. Returning Results 📊
   
After performing the comparison, the agent returns the following results:

Similarity score: A percentage that indicates how similar the two codes are 📊

Differences: A list of textual differences between the codes 🔠

Technical terms: A list of technical terms for each code and their intersection 🏗️

Common terms: Terms that appear in both codes, helping to identify areas of alignment 🌐

Features 🚀

Automated Code Comparison: Leverages Fetch.ai's agent to perform building code comparisons between two jurisdictions 🔄

Detailed Analysis: Provides similarity scores, highlights technical differences, and extracts common technical terms 📊🔍

Interactive Frontend: Built with Streamlit, users can select jurisdictions and view detailed comparison results 🔎📑

Timeline Analysis: Understand the history of building code updates over time for each jurisdiction 📅
